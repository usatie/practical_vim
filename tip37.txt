# Track Open Files with the Buffer List
## Understand the Distinction Between Files and Buffers
buffer is an in-memory representation of a file.


## Meet the Buffer List
$ cd code/files
$ vim *.txt
2 files to edit

:ls       : show the listing of all the buffers
            % symbol indicates which of the buffers is visible in the current window
			# symbol represents the alternate file
:bn[ext]  : switch to the next buffer in the list
<C-^>     : toggle between the current and alternate files


## Use the Buffer List
### vim-unimpaired
https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired

:bn[ext]        : move forward in the buffer list
:bp[revious]    : move forward in the buffer list
:bf[irst]       : jump to the start of the buffer list
:bl[ast]        : jump to the last of the buffer list

nnoremap <silent> [b :bprevious<CR>
nnoremap <silent> ]b :bnext<CR>
nnoremap <silent> [B :bfirst<CR>
nnoremap <silent> ]B :blast<CR>

[b              : bprevious
]b              : bnext
[B              : bfirst
[B              : blast
[a              : next argument
]a              : previous argument
[q              : next quickfix
]q              : previous quickfix
[l              : next location
]l              : previous location
[t              : next tag
]t              : previoust tag

### others
:b[uffer] N         : jump to buffer N
:b[uffer] {bufname} : jump to buffer uniquely identified by {bufname}
:bufdo {command}    : execute Ex command in all of the buffers

## Deleting Buffers
:bd[elete] N1 N2 N3 : delete buffers N1, N2, and N3
:N,M bd[elete]      : delete buffers from N to M inclusive
