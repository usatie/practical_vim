>:bnext
E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)
>:bnext!
>ls
1 #h + "a.txt"                    line 1
2 %a   "b.txt"                    line 0

h for hidden

## Handle Hidden Buffers on Quit
:quit
E37: No write since last change
E162: No write since last change for buffer "tip39.txt"

:qall!   : quit Vim without reviewing our unsaved changes
:wall    : write all modified buffers without reviewing them one by one

## Enable the 'Hidden' Setting Before Running ':*do' Commands
:argdo {cmd} works like this:
>:first
>{cmd}
>next
>{cmd}
etc.

That's why :next command will fail because {cmd} changed the first buffer!

:argdo {cmd} | update
will works fine.
